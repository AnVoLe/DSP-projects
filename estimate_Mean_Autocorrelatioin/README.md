This program estimates the mean and std of available data interms of different block sizes. The figures of estimated mean and the table of standard deviation for each block size are shown.
Available data N=1024. There are 4 cases of the block size M=[8 32 128 256] in this program.
The results:

Each row of the table below shows the estimated std and true std for each case of the block size 8,32,128,256:

we can see the the bigger block size, the smaller standard deviation and the mean is less fluctuating.
