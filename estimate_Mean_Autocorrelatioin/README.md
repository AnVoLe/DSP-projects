This program estimates the mean of available data interms of different block sizes. The figures of estimated mean and a table of standard deviation for each block size are shown.
Available data N=1024. There are 4 cases of the block size M=[8 32 128 256] in this program.
The results:

Each row of the table below shows the estimated std and true std for each case of the block size 8,32,128,256:

we can see the the bigger block size, the smaller standard deviation and the mean does not fluctuate.
