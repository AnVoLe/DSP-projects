This program is run in MATLAB simulink to provide the idea how the gradient descent algorithm works.
The source signals are generated from signal builder block, and I use the zero-oder hold block to set the sampling time for the process. 
This algorithm can be used to estimate channel gains in wirelesss communication systems.
