This program does decimation an input sample which includes filtering process( convolution) and down-sampling.
I have written this program in both C and MATLAB. MATLAB is in another folder. I wrote all my own functions including decimate_by_2, downsample_by_2 and my_convolution.
In this C program: 
decimate_by_2 is downsample_by_2
downsample_by_2 is decimate_by_2
just a misunderstood at the begining.

•	Given the audio samples and filter coefficients:

•	Output downsample(decimate actually) array:
